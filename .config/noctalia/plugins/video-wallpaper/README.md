A plugin to have a video as your wallpaper. Uses either Qt6 Multimedia or mpvpaper as rendering backends with multi-monitor support.

## Features

## Troubleshooting

### Videos not playing

- Ensure you have the selected backend installed (qt6-multimedia or mpvpaper).
- Check that ffmpeg is installed.
- Verify that you have selected a wallpaper to display.

### Performance issues

Playing a video wallpaper takes A LOT of resources from your system. There are some things you can try out:

- Try out the other backend and see if that one works better for you.
- If using mpvpaper, set the profile to fast, and try enabling the hardware acceleration.
- Reduce the video resolution of the video playing.

### Multi-monitor setup

If you want your monitors to have different wallpaper configurations, go to the plugin settings and enable the monitor-specific settings. Then choose the different settings for your different monitors.
